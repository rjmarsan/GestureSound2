JCollider needs your help!

unfortunately I don't have enough time to devote to JCollider anymore.
During the course of 2006 and 2007, I need to turn all of my software
projects into multiple-developers projects to gain resources for new
projects.

I'm looking for people who are willing to help and co-develop JCollider.

Minimum skills of developers:
- good experience in java programming
- good experience in supercollider programming

Optimum skills of developers:
- interest in electroacoustic / experimental music
- interest in developing application on top of jcollider

What i offer:
- help with all programming questions
- help with finishing documentation
- help with understanding my style of programming
- help with setting up development mailing lists and resources
- help to move the project to a cross-platform IDE (e.g. Eclipse)

Suggested next development steps:
- finish API documentation
- integration of missing methods (mirrored from sclang)
- extensive testing of all methods
- improving Server class robustness

Possible long term goals:
- evaluating pros/cons for transition to java 1.5
- making it rely more on java's strengths and loosening connection to sclang
